### **Week 1: Sonic Speeds & Algebra Foundations**
**📘 IXL Skills**: [IXL U.2 – Solve multi-step linear equations](https://www.ixl.com/math/algebra-1/solve-multi-step-linear-equations)
**📚 Common Core Dropdown**: HSA.CED.A.1, HSA.REI.B.3
**Focus:** Expressions, Equations, and Linear Functions

- **Jeremiah-Specific Lessons**:
  - Compare Sonic's 767 mph speed to Jeremiah’s 40-yard dash time.
  - Solve for how long it takes Sonic to cross Lincoln Park.
  - Create an equation modeling Jeremiah’s Segway route incline.
  - Build a graphic showing time vs distance in Sonic/Jeremiah race.

### **Week 2: Football Physics & Quadratics**
**📘 IXL Skills**: [IXL J.7 – Graph parabolas](https://www.ixl.com/math/algebra-1/graph-a-quadratic-function)
**📚 Common Core Dropdown**: HSA.REI.B.4
**Focus:** Quadratic Functions and Vertex Form

- **Jeremiah-Specific Lessons**:
  - Use football launch angle and height data to build quadratic models.
  - Model real game throw distances using vertex form.
  - Analyze which angles give Jeremiah max yardage per play.
  - Complete the square to find the vertex of each throw model.

### **Week 3: Naruto Motion & Systems of Equations**
**📘 IXL Skills**: [IXL W.10 – Solve a system of equations by graphing](https://www.ixl.com/math/algebra-1/solve-a-system-of-equations-by-graphing)
**📚 Common Core Dropdown**: HSA.CED.A.3
**Focus:** Simultaneous Equations and Real-Life Situations

- **Jeremiah-Specific Lessons**:
  - Compare Jeremiah on foot, Segway, and Sonic with 3 equations.
  - Calculate intersection points to simulate "overtake" moments.
  - Apply systems to his football playbooks – passing vs rushing gains.
  - Use dual commission structures from Mom’s real estate deals.

### **Week 4: NJIT Bound – Inequalities & Review Challenges**
**📘 IXL Skills**: [IXL Y.5 – Graph compound inequalities](https://www.ixl.com/math/algebra-1/graph-compound-inequalities)
**📚 Common Core Dropdown**: HSA.REI.D.12, HSA.CED.A.2
