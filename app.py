**A 4-Week Challenge-Based Math Journey for Jeremiah Erskine**

Welcome, **Future NJIT Engineer**! This MathCraft program transforms 9th grade math review into an epic quest, blending Jeremiah’s passions—quarterback mechanics, Sonic speed, Segway adventures, and real estate success with his mother Rose from South Africa—into mathematical mastery.

---

### 🎯 Program Goal:
Prepare Jeremiah for a confident 10th grade math experience by reinforcing foundational skills through a personalized, interest-based curriculum rooted in Common Core standards, with Rose as his inspiring partner.

### 🧑🏿‍🏫 Who is Dr. X?
Dr. X isn’t a robot 🤓—he’s modeled after Xavier Honablue M.Ed, a real educator who wears glasses. He’s your sideline coach for math, cheering Jeremiah and Rose on!

    📚 **Math Lesson:** Speed is calculated as distance divided by time (Speed = Distance/Time). Here, Jeremiah’s 40-yard dash time is converted to mph using the formula:  
    Speed (mph) = (40 yards × 3600 seconds/hour) / (dash time × 5280 yards/mile). Sonic’s speed is a constant 767 mph. The ratio helps us compare their speeds, a key skill in HSA.CED.A.1 for creating equations!
    **Example Problem:** If Jeremiah runs 40 yards in 5 seconds, what’s his speed in mph?  
    Solution: Speed = (40 × 3600) / (5 × 5280) ≈ 5.45 mph. Try adjusting the slider to see how time affects speed!
    **Practice:** Create your own speed equation for a different distance (e.g., 100 yards) and solve it.

    **Example Problem:** If C₁ = 3%P and C₂ = 2.5%P + 2000, what’s the break-even price?

    # Story: Jeremiah and Rose’s Big Flip
    st.markdown("""
    🌍 **Story Time with Jeremiah and Rose:** Rose shared stories of flipping homes in South Africa, and now in Jersey City, they picked a property to transform. Jeremiah crunched the numbers, saying, “Mom, with this ROI, we’ll be real estate kings!” Rose hugged him, proud of their teamwork.

    # Teaching Text
    st.markdown("""
    📚 **Math Lesson:** Investment growth uses the compound interest formula: Future Value = Present Value × (1 + r)^t, where r is the appreciation rate and t is time. Adding rental income and calculating ROI (Return / Investment × 100) ties to HSF.BF.A.1 for modeling relationships—Jeremiah and Rose’s path to success!  
    **Example Problem:** If price = $400,000, rent = $3,000/month, and appreciation = 4% over 5 years, what’s the total ROI?  
    Solution: Future value ≈ $487,000, total rent = $180,000, ROI ≈ 67.5%. Adjust sliders to experiment!
    **Practice:** Calculate ROI for a 3% appreciation rate over 3 years.
